From the New York Times:

Think of ranked-choice voting as voting in rounds: If a single candidate
receives more than 50 percent of first-choice votes in the first round, then
he or she wins, and that's the end of the race.

If no one exceeds 50 percent of votes in the first round, the candidate in
last place is eliminated, and all other candidates move on to the next round.
All the votes for the eliminated candidate will be reallocated to whichever
candidate those voters ranked second, and then the votes are retabulated.
Then the candidate in last place after that will be eliminated.

In New York's primary, these rounds of elimination will continue until there
are two candidates left - even if a candidate collects more than 50 percent of
votes before the very end. The candidate with the most votes in the final
round wins. In each round, when a candidate gets eliminated, his or her votes
get redistributed to whoever was ranked next on the ballot.
